<p>INE starts right into Architecture Fundamentals, Assembler, and BoF (Buffer Overflows) and itâ€™s a bit daunting.  Also, itâ€™s quite a curve from fun eLearning Security Labs for the eJPT into this massive slide show, notetaking â€œH E Double Hockey Sticksâ€ that I am in right now.  Where are the fun labs?  Where are the videos?  Where am I?  What is anything, really?</p>
