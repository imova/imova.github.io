I"ù<p>I overtaxed myself with teaching, fulltime job, two small kiddos, building a house, that I didn‚Äôt have any time to dedicate to the PTP class.  Pluse, yep, this BOF portion of the course is too much.  So I am going to just look elsewhere to learn som BOF, and then skim these slides.  I have until October to get through it all.  This is my rejuvinated idea, and well, it‚Äôs the first day of spring too.</p>
