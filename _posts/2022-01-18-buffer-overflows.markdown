![So Frustrating](/images/frustrated-ugh.gif)

INE starts right into Architecture Fundamentals, Assembler, and BoF (Buffer Overflows) and it's a bit daunting.  Also, it's quite a curve from fun eLearning Security Labs for the eJPT into this massive slide show, notetaking "H E Double Hockey Sticks" that I am in right now.  Where are the fun labs?  Where are the videos?  Where am I?  What is anything, really?
