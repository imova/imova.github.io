I overtaxed myself with teaching, fulltime job, two small kiddos, and building a house, that I didn't have any time to dedicate to the PTP class.  Plus, yep, this BOF portion of the course is too much.  What i mean by that is that there is just endless slides.  I can't keep myself accountable to go through the mundane parts.   So I am going to just look elsewhere to learn some BOF, and then skim these slides.  I have until October to get through it all as that is when the class expires.  This is my rejuvinated idea, and well, it's the first day of spring too. :four_leaf_clover:
