Okay folks, I need to get back to studying, and PTP isn't cutting it.  Let's get a Tryhackme account, and start building back up.  It's September, and my INE account will run out in less than a month, which doesn't give me a lot of time to study.  I do think it's important to keep on building here, so let's do it!
