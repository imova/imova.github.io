Work vouched for an Offensive Security Learn One Subscription! It started in January, and I am about 4 topics in.  To be honest, at this rate, I might not make it to the end of the year test.  So I have to study, hard.  Currently playing with Powershell and Powercat.  I have to say that in my journey to learn PenTesting, Offsec really takes the cake.  I don't drown in PowerPoint, and there are some really practical exercises along with a great discord community.  I just need to commit some time to really studying.  Let's do it this weekend and knock out Topic 4.  My goal is to be in topic 9 by end of March.
