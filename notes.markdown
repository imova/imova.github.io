Hey All -

These are my notes for the PTP Course with INE.  The notes are helping me prep for the eCPPTv2.

## Pre-Course Material

[The Journey to Try Harder: TJnullâ€™s Preparation Guide for PEN-200 PWK/OSCP 2.0](https://www.netsecfocus.com/oscp/2021/05/06/The_Journey_to_Try_Harder-_TJnull-s_Preparation_Guide_for_PEN-200_PWK_OSCP_2.0.html)

Here are some hacking courses that are cheap and you can do on the side that will take you from zero to hero! The courses are in order I'd do and then I included hacking labs and their prices! TryHackMe is a much more friendly intro lab then could move to HTB.

Note: if you follow these guys on Twitter they post discount codes for their courses all the time, some are just pinned on their Twitter profile.
